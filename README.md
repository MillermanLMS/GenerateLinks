**Note:** this project in beta.

Welcome to my marking system. This project is one part of several systems that enable more effective and consistent marking of student assignments and tests. 

The end goal is to make a crisp, consistent workflow for generating lecture notes, assignments and simplifying the assignment marking process overall. Current technologies that are being looked at to accomplish this include:
- Angular
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- ExpressJS
- Markdown for content composition
- RevealJS for lecture slides

Secondary products to manage the project that will be used include:
- Jira for bug/feature tracking
- GitHub/GitHub Actions
- Netlify

If you're a student of mine and you're interested gaining some experience in agile bug/feature workflows, working more in depth with GitHub, and learning some more advanced angular programming, definitely let me know!
